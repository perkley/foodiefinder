Open CloudFormation

1. Create the Secrets Manager and Cognito:
    - Run cognito_secrets_manager.yaml and choose Lab Role
    - In 'AWS Cognito', select your 'User Pool' > 'App integration' > click on your 'App Client name' and under 'Hosted UI customization' you can upload the logo: 'foodiefinder_cognito_logo.png' and 'Cognito_UI.css'

2. Create the Django Instance and Elastic IP:
    - Run django_to_ec2_instance.yaml and choose Lab Role
    - Accept the 'I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources.' and submit

3. Find out what the Secret Name is (IE: FoodieFinderAppSecrets)
    - Get the Elastic IP and update the 'allowed_hosts' variable and the 'CognitoLoginRedirectUrl' and 'CognitoLogoutRedirectUrl' in the Secrets Manager (Remember, it needs to be https for the redirect urls)

4. EC2 Connect
    - Get into the server and make sure it has finished successfully!
        - cat /var/log/progress.log
    - We need to update the secrets.json to know where to find the secrets manager.
        - sudo vim /home/ubuntu/foodiefinder/secrets.json
    - Then restart gunicorn
        sudo supervisorctl reload
    - If errors try:
        tail -f /var/log/gunicorn/gunicorn.err.log

5. Update Cognito App Client Allowed Callback and sign-out URLs (These must match the exact same as you have written in the Secrets Manager)
    - https://100.28.180.50/callback
    - https://100.28.180.50
